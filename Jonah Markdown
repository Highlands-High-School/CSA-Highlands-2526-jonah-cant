# Done with the Course  

## What I Actually Learned  
- How to kinda use GitHub without breaking it  
- That markdown is just fancy text but with symbols  
- How to open a pull request (still feels like magic tbh)  

---

## What I’m Still Confused About  
- Merge conflicts... like why do they exist  
- When I’m supposed to fork vs. branch  
- Honestly, just remembering all the steps without clicking the wrong thing  

ok that’s it.
